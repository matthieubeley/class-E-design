Analytical equations describing the optimal ideal class E inverter, and class E rectifier by duality, are written in the form of a matlab code in "classE_design.m".
Document "ClassE_design.pdf" explains its structure.

Additional files "Chart_Inv_Class_E.jpg" and "Chart_Inv+Rec_Class_E.jpg" are support for the design of such circuits.

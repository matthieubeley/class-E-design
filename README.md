Analytical equations describing the optimal ideal class E inverter, and class E rectifier by duality, are written in the form of a matlab code in "classE_design.m".
Document "ClassE_design.pdf" explains its structure.

Charts are support for the design of such circuits. They allow for an exploration of the design space and help the designer to identify one or several design points.

Yet to be implemented --> analytical expressions for :
1) non-zero voltage slope at turn-on (non-ZdVS)
2) non-zero voltage drop at turn-on (non-ZVS)
3) Impact of stray inductance in series with the switch
4) Series filter tuned on harmonic n (class E frequency multiplier)

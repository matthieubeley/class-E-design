Analytical equations describing the optimal ideal class E inverter, and class E rectifier by duality, are written in the form of a matlab code in "classE_design.m".
Document "ClassE_design.pdf" explains its structure.

Charts are support for the design of such circuits. They allow for an exploration of the design space and help the designer to identify one or several design points.
